## Mailu Features and projects

All code we contribute to the Mailu repository, whether paid or not, follow the same Copyright scheme as Mailu. This means that Copyright belongs to the Author and the code is licensed under the "MIT license". Mohlmann Solutions SRL is the holder of the copyright of the code added by usrpro.

### Limitations

Any project that are undertaken by us might rely on libraries of third parties. The design of each feature we offer will be based on libraries that are compatible with MIT. This excludes GPL-like licensed libraries. Usrpro and Mohlmann Solutions SRL do not assume any responsibly for copyright or license infringement caused by contributions from outside our organization.\

### Guarantees

The MIT license disclaims warranty of any kind. However, as a provider of funded features, we want to provide a trusted workflow for our investors. Therefore we commit to the following promisses:

1. In Alpha testing, our code will receive performance improvements, bug fixes and refactoring based on peer and investor review;
2. Code that is in a pull request will receive bug fixes and compatibility fixes bases on Mailu's review policy;
3. After merge, we will provide for bug-fixes for anything this feature broke, based on a best effort time span;

Outside these promises, we still waive any liability as laid out in the MIT license.

## Other projects

Usrpro is developing other projects on GitHub or elsewhere. Some repositories in our GitHub organization are forked from other developers or organizations. Every project caries its own license. All contributions done by usrpro are done under the license of each such project.
