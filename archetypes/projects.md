## Current situation

## Added functionality

## Scope

[Usrpro](/about/company/) offers to implement this feature.  This project will follow our general [road map](/about/projects-roadmap). The roadmap explains thoroughly which steps we will undertake to implement this feature and its crowd-funding. Until the "alpha testing" phase we promise to deliver:

### Licensing

Development will be done inside a public repository inside the usrpro organization of Github. All contributions will carry the MIT license, just like the Mailu upstream repository. Note that the license excludes the possibility of GPL-like licensed libraries and the design will depend on this restriction. During the development of this feature we commit to some additional guarantees outside the MIT license's warranty disclaimer. Please refer to our [Copyright and Licensing](/about/copyright-and-licensing/) page for more information.

## Costs

Usrpro believes it can benefit from this added functionality. We are looking for a partial funding of the development effort, so that the investment burden can be shared among other interested parties. As such we are able to offer works on the project as low as 15 euro per hour. After the design phase is concluded, we are able to do a final man-hour budget. The final budget will be our binding offer for implementing our scope. This menas that the implementation costs can't rise once we start crowdfunding and we assume responsibility for delivering the project within budget.
